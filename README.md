### [Machine Learning Project: Predicting Late Delivery Risk in Supply Chain Management](https://github.com/rkaushick-neu/info6105-data_science/blob/main/FinalProject/RishabhLK_FinalProjectReport_PDF.pdf)
- Experimented with multiple supervised learning models to predict if a shipment has a risk of late delivery.
- Performed significant data engineering tasks like pre-processing on a dataset containing around 9,000,000 data points.
- Extracted top 15 most important features & trained a new model on it resulting in an accuracy score of 97%.
- Performed hyper-parameter tuning using Randomized Search CV

### Data Science Project: Classifying Whether a Near Earth Object (NEO) Is Potentially Hazardous
- Benchmarked various supervised learning appraoches using decision tree-based & neighborhood-based models.
- Used dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA & ICA leading to a slight improvement to the accuracy.
- Implemented unsupervised clustering as a feature engineering technique & re-trained the neural network model for a 14% increase in accuracy.

### Machine Learning Research Project to Detect Parkinson’s Disease using MRI Data
- Applied strong Python skills for data cleaning, and feature extraction from biomedical image data (MRIs).
- Extracted 105 radiomics features and applied additional 13 filters on each feature to obtain 1,300+ features.
- The above data augmentation improved the accuracy of the model from 65% to 80%.
- The insights from this project were used in the research paper publication: [‘Predicting markers for Parkinson’s
Disease using Deep Neural Nets on neuromelanin sensitive MRI’](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158219300981?via%3Dihub) in the NeuroImage: Clinical Journal.
