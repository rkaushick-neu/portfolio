## Academic Projects
### NLP Project on Multi-Label Text Classification of English Quotes ([Link](https://github.com/rkaushick-neu/nlp-quotes))
- Used [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Abirate/english_quotes) from Hugging Face as a basis for multi-label text classification.
- Performed tokenization, lemmatization, stemming and stop word removal as a means of data cleaning
- Handled imbalanced class distribution by under-sampling the data (see image below).
- Used Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for vectorization.
- Trained baseline Naïve Bayes Classifiers along with an LSTM recurrant neural network.
- Evaluated the models using metrics in the classification report like precision, recall and f1-score.

(Projcet W.I.P. to improve on the existing models. Check back here soon!!)

### Forecasting Apple Stock using Classical Machine Learning & Deep Learning Approaches ([Link](https://github.com/rkaushick-neu/stock-forecasting-ml-dl/tree/main))
- Worked on a regression problem with a time-series [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/edarchimbaud/timeseries-1d-stocks) of the S&P 500 stocks.
- Compared different classical models like Random Forest & XGBoost Regressors along with deep learning Long-Term-Short-Term (LSTM) Recurrant Neural Networks.
- Used metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the R Squared score to evaluate each model.

### Machine Learning Project: Predicting Late Delivery Risk in Supply Chain Management ([Link](https://github.com/rkaushick-neu/machine-learning-scm))
- Experimented with multiple supervised learning models to predict if a shipment has a risk of late delivery.
- Performed significant data engineering tasks like pre-processing on a dataset containing around 9,000,000 data points.
- Extracted top 15 most important features & trained a new model on it resulting in an accuracy score of 97%.
- Performed hyper-parameter tuning using Randomized Search CV

### Data Science Project: Classifying Whether a Near Earth Object (NEO) Is Potentially Hazardous
- Benchmarked various supervised learning appraoches using decision tree-based & neighborhood-based models.
- Used dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA & ICA leading to a slight improvement to the accuracy.
- Implemented unsupervised clustering as a feature engineering technique & re-trained the neural network model for a 14% increase in accuracy.

### Machine Learning Research Project to Detect Parkinson’s Disease using MRI Data
- Applied strong Python skills for data cleaning, and feature extraction from biomedical image data (MRIs).
- Extracted 105 radiomics features and applied additional 13 filters on each feature to obtain 1,300+ features.
- The above data augmentation improved the accuracy of the model from 65% to 80%.
- The insights from this project were used in the research paper publication: [‘Predicting markers for Parkinson’s
Disease using Deep Neural Nets on neuromelanin sensitive MRI’](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158219300981?via%3Dihub) in the NeuroImage: Clinical Journal.
